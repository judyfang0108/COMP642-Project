# Tomato Leaf Diseases Classification and Real-World Application

This project involves using machine learning models to perform image classification tasks. The models compared include Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and ResNet18. Each model is contained within separate Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate their respective performances.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run the Jupyter notebooks to evaluate the performances of the MLP, CNN, and ResNet18 models on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - TensorFlow 2.x
  - Keras
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - OpenCV
  - PIL
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python pillow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras torch torchvision tqdm
```

### Running the Notebooks

1. **MLP and CNN Notebook**
   - Navigate to the directory containing `MLP_CNN.ipynb`.
   - Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook MLP_CNN.ipynb
     ```
   - Run the cells sequentially to see the performance results for both the MLP and CNN models.

2. **ResNet18 Notebook**
   - Navigate to the directory containing `ResNet18.ipynb`.
   - Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook ResNet18.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute the cells in order to view the results for the ResNet18 model.

## Viewing the Results

Each notebook includes detailed steps and code cells for detailed visualizations of the training process, including loss and accuracy plots, as well as confusion matrices and classification reports to evaluate the model performance.

Run each cell in the notebooks to move through the process from data loading to model evaluation.

For the complete analysis and additional details, refer to the full Jupyter Notebook or the report pdf available in the repository.
